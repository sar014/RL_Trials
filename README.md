This is a Neural Network project which uses reinforcement learning for making a car move

The car has been downloaded from Unity Asset Store. I have not pushed it 

Also if you are creating a copy of the project you have to create a virtual environment. Refer Code Monkey video
Install the follwoing dependencies in venv:
Before venv:
py -3.9 -m venv venv

After venv:
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install mlagents
pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio
pip install protobuf==3.20.3
pip install packaging

Note that i have used py 3.7 because unity ml agents works with py 3.7
